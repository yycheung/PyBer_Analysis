# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 
 The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type(urban, sub urban and rural), and create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. After that, a summary will be drawn to discuss on how the data differs by city type and suggest how to improve the revene by narrow the disparity among those differences.

 ## Summary

![](analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png)

 In the multiple-line graph shows an obviouse disparities of total weekly fares for each city type. The total fares in urban cities is the highest, and never overlaps with suburban and rural. To increase the revenue from suburban and rural, suggestions are as follows:
 
 
 * To increase the number of driver
 The low fares in rural cities might due to lack of drivers, we would suggest to increase the number of driver by referral promotion and credit reward.

* Lower the average fare per ride in rural cities
Another reason of low fares in rural and suburban cities might be because of high riding cost. We would suggest lower the average fare per ride in rural cities, since it is the highest in rural cities. 

* Ride promotion
Apart from lower the average fares, We would suggest introducing ride promotion, which is ride more reward more, to appeal potential passengers to take the ride more often.
